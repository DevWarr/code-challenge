# code-challenge

### Welcome to the Whitebox Code Challenge!

In this repo, you're given an HTML template for an ecommerce store. It has only 2 pages. A main products list page, and a single product detail page. This is only HTML & CSS. Your goal, is to 1) build a nodeJS server to serve some fake data, and 2) wire up both HTML pages to your new server.


Here is where you can get your fake JSON data. You can use this URL directly in your NodeJS Server.
https://next.json-generator.com/api/json/get/EkzBIUWNL

### More specifically we're looking for:

1) Create a NodeJS server that has 2 endpoints. GetMany should return the entire list of fake products. GetSingle should accept an ID, and return just that 1 product.

2) Create an SPA which wires up the static HTML given in the repo (You can
use (or not) any framework you're comfortable with).  

3) "Wire up" includes any search, sort or filters you see on the page.

3) The SPA should have 2 pages, a list all products, and an individual
product page. Both HTML templates are provided.

4) Delivery should be a separate github repo on your own account.

### Tips
- You shouldn't have to mess with the CSS much.
- For experienced developers I've seen this challenge take less than an hour. For new developers I've seen this challenge take up to 4 hours.
- Let me know if you have any questions or things you want clarified.
- We're looking for your ability to use Javascript, code style and structure and ability to follow the technical requirements listed in this readme.
